## Overview

[Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/) is a video communications platform that enables users to schedule, host, and join virtual meetings, webinars, and conferences.

The `ballerinax/zoom.scheduler` package offers APIs to connect ant interract with [Zoom Scheduler](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/scheduler) endpoints. specifically based on Zoom API v2.


## Setup guide

To use the Zoom scheduler connector, you must have access to the Zoom API through [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and a project under it. If you do not have a Zoom account, you can sign up for one [here](https://zoom.us/signup#/signup).

### Step 1: Create a new app

1. Open the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

2. Click "Develop" â†’ "Build App"

    <img src="docs/setup/resources/zoom-marketplace.png" alt="Zoom marketplace" style="width: 70%;">

3. Choose **"General App"** app type (for user authorization with refresh tokens)

   <img src="docs/setup/resources/app-type.png" alt="App Type" style="width: 70%;">

4. Fill in basic information

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Settings

3. **Note down your credentials**:
   * Client ID
   * Client Secret

   <img src="docs/setup/resources/app-credentials.png" alt="App Credentials" style="width: 70%;">

2. **Set Redirect URI**: Add your application's redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/callback`)
      <img src="docs/setup/resources/redirect-URI.png" alt="Scope" style="width: 70%;">

3. **Add Scopes**: Make sure your Zoom app has the necessary scopes for the Scheduler API:
   * Add `scheduler:read`, `scheduler:write` and `user:read` in the scope

   <img src="docs/setup/resources/zoom-scopes.png" alt="Scope" style="width: 70%;">


### Step 3: Activate the App

1. Complete all required information
2. Activate the app

   <img src="docs/setup/resources/activate-app.png" alt="Activate App" style="width: 70%;">

### Step 4: Get User Authorization

1. **Direct users to authorization URL** (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`):
```
https://zoom.us/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=scheduler:read scheduler:write user:read
```

2. **User authorizes the app** and gets redirected to your callback URL with an authorization code

3. **Exchange authorization code for tokens**:
```curl
curl -X POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' | base64)" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

This returns both `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

* Replace:
   * `CLIENT_ID` with your app's Client ID
   * `CLIENT_SECRET` with your app's Client Secret
   * `AUTHORIZATION_CODE` with the code received from the callback
   * `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your configured redirect URI

### Step 5: Verify Your Setup
```curl
curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
This will give you the user ID needed for API calls.

### Step 6: Configure the Connector

#### Option 1: Use Config.toml (Recommended)

```toml
isLiveServer = true
clientId = "your_client_id"
clientSecret = "your_client_secret"
refreshToken = "user_refresh_token_from_step4"
refreshUrl = "https://zoom.us/oauth/token"
userId = "user_id_from_step5"
```

#### Option 2: Use Environment Variables
```bash
export IS_LIVE_SERVER="true"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"  
export ZOOM_REFRESH_TOKEN="user_refresh_token_from_step4"
export ZOOM_USER_ID="user_id_from_step5"
```

### Benefits of This Setup

**Long-lived tokens** - Refresh tokens don't expire like Server-to-Server tokens  
**Automatic refresh** - Connector handles token refresh automatically  
**User consent** - Users explicitly authorize your app  
**Secure** - Follows OAuth2 best practices

### Alternative: Server-to-Server OAuth

If you prefer automated access without user interaction (tokens expire hourly):

1. Choose **"Server-to-Server OAuth"** in Step 1
2. Use account credentials grant:
```curl
curl -X POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' | base64)" \
  -d "grant_type=account_credentials&account_id=ACCOUNT_ID"
```
3. Configure with bearer token:
```toml
isLiveServer = true
token = "your_access_token"
userId = "your_user_id"
```
## Quickstart

To use the `Zoom` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `zoom.scheduler` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/zoom.scheduler;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

```bash
token = "<Access Token>"
```

2. Create a `zoom.scheduler:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained access token and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string token = ?;

final zoom.scheduler:Client zoom.scheduler = check new({
    auth: {
        token
    }
});
```
### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Schedule a meeting

```ballerina
<!-- to do -->
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```

## Examples

The `Zoom Scheduler` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/), covering the following use cases:

* **[Meeting Scheduler](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/meeting-scheduler)** - Create scheduled meetings, generate single-use scheduling links, and manage team meeting schedules with automated booking capabilities.

* **[Availability Manager](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/availability-manager)** - Configure availability schedules, analyze scheduler analytics, and manage working hours for different time zones and business requirements.
