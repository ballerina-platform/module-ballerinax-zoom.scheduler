## Overview

[Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/) is a video communications platform that enables users to schedule, host, and join virtual meetings, webinars, and conferences.

The `ballerinax/zoom.scheduler` package offers APIs to connect ant interract with [Zoom Scheduler](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/scheduler) endpoints. specifically based on Zoom API v2.

## Setup guide

To use the `ballerinax/zoom.scheduler` connector, you must have access to the Zoom API through [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and a project under it. If you do not have a Zoom account, you can sign up for one [here](https://zoom.us/signup#/signup).

### Step 1: Create a new app

1. Open the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

2. Click "Develop" â†’ "Build App"

     ![Zoom marketplace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/refs/heads/main/docs/setup/resources/zoom-marketplace.png)   
3. Choose **"General App"** app type (for user authorization with refresh tokens)

   ![App Type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/refs/heads/main/docs/setup/resources/app-type.png)

4. Fill in basic information

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Settings

3. **Note down your credentials**:
   * Client ID
   * Client Secret

   ![App Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/refs/heads/main/docs/setup/resources/app-credentials.png)

2. **Set Redirect URI**: Add your application's redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/callback`)
      ![Redirect URI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/refs/heads/main/docs/setup/resources/redirect-URI.png)

3. **Add Scopes**: Make sure your Zoom app has the necessary scopes for the Scheduler API:
   * Add `scheduler:read`, `scheduler:write` and `user:read` in the scope

### Step 3: Activate the App

1. Complete all required information
2. Activate the app

   ![Activate App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/refs/heads/main/docs/setup/resources/activate-app.png)

### Step 4: Get User Authorization

1. **Direct users to authorization URL** (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`):
```
https://zoom.us/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=scheduler:read scheduler:write user:read
```

2. **User authorizes the app** and gets redirected to your callback URL with an authorization code

3. **Exchange authorization code for tokens**:
```curl
curl -X POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' | base64)" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

This returns both `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

* Replace:
   * `CLIENT_ID` with your app's Client ID
   * `CLIENT_SECRET` with your app's Client Secret
   * `AUTHORIZATION_CODE` with the code received from the callback
   * `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI` with your configured redirect URI

### Step 5: Verify Your Setup
```curl
curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
This will give you the user ID needed for API calls.

## Quickstart

To use the `ballerinax/zoom.scheduler` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `zoom.scheduler` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/zoom.scheduler;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

1. Create a `Config.toml` file and, configure the obtained credentials in the above steps as follows:

```bash
token = "<Access Token>"
```

2. Create a `zoom.scheduler:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained access token and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string token = ?;

final zoom.scheduler:Client zoom.scheduler = check new({
    auth: {
        token
    }
});
```
### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Create a schedule

```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {
    zoom.scheduler:InlineResponse2011 schedule = check zoom.scheduler->/schedules.post(
        payload = {
            summary: "Team Meeting",
            description: "Weekly team sync",
            duration: 60
        }
    );
    io:println("Schedule created with ID: ", schedule.scheduleId);
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```

## Examples

The `Zoom Scheduler` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/), covering the following use cases:

* **[Meeting Scheduler](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/meeting-scheduler)** - Create scheduled meetings, generate single-use scheduling links, and manage team meeting schedules with automated booking capabilities.

* **[Availability Manager](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-zoom.scheduler/tree/main/examples/availability-manager)** - Configure availability schedules, analyze scheduler analytics, and manage working hours for different time zones and business requirements.
